This task holds paramount significance in the early diagnosis of critical eye conditions, including Glaucoma and Diabetic Retinopathy. By harnessing cutting-edge technology and artificial intelligence, our solution streamlines and enhances this essential medical image analysis process.</p> <p>The process begins with the ingestion of RGB images, which undergo a series of carefully orchestrated steps. First, they are resized to a standardized format, ensuring consistency in input data. Then, a meticulous preprocessing pipeline is applied to isolate the Region of Interest (RoI), which isolates the optic disc for further analysis.</p> <p>The core of our system is a deep neural network model, fine-tuned for the specific task of optic disc segmentation. This model leverages its architectural complexity to deliver accurate and reliable results, providing healthcare professionals with a valuable tool for early disease detection.</p> <p>The web application interface offers users a seamless and intuitive experience, allowing them to upload images and obtain segmented results effortlessly. Our project stands at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and healthcare, contributing to the early identification and management of sight-threatening conditions, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life.</p>"},{"location":"#technical-resources","title":"Technical Resources","text":""},{"location":"#frontend","title":"Frontend","text":"<ul> <li>React.js</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#backend","title":"Backend","text":"<ul> <li>Django</li> <li>SQLite</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#roles","title":"Roles","text":""},{"location":"#front-end-development","title":"Front End Development","text":"<ul> <li>Subham</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#back-end-development","title":"Back End Development","text":"<ul> <li>Hyeon</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#collaborating-tools","title":"Collaborating Tools","text":""},{"location":"#communication","title":"Communication","text":"<ul> <li>Whatsapp (:</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#project-management","title":"Project Management","text":"<ul> <li>Github Projects</li> </ul>"},{"location":"project-plan/","title":"Project Management","text":"<p>This page provides a general overview of the assigned tasks and roles for the duration of four sprints (subject to change).</p>"},{"location":"project-plan/#project-plan","title":"Project Plan","text":""},{"location":"project-plan/#sprint-1-finished-requirements-software-and-project-management-documents","title":"Sprint 1: Finished requirements, software and project management documents","text":""},{"location":"project-plan/#due-sep-27","title":"Due: Sep 27","text":"Rubric Description Task To-Do Assigned To Date To Complete By Requirement Specification Create use cases or user stories All Sep 25 Release Planning Create project plan All Sep 25 Release Planning Clear responsibility assignment All Sep 25 Project Overview Create project overview description Subham Sep 25 Teamwork Create meeting minutes All Sep 25 Submission Create mkdocs Hyeon Sep 25"},{"location":"project-plan/#sprint-2-created-working-prototype-with-some-should-have-user-stories-implimented","title":"Sprint 2: Created working prototype with some should have user stories implimented","text":""},{"location":"project-plan/#due-oct-11","title":"Due: Oct 11","text":"Rubric Description Task To-Do Assigned To Date To Complete By Requirements Plan documented in the git issue tracker Hyeon Oct 5 Requirements Create project plan for sprint 3, 4 and 5 All Oct 5 Requirements Look for specific library for react Subham Oct 5 Codebase Set up project starter All Oct 5 Codebase US 6.01 - Secure Ophthalmologist Authentication All Oct 11 Codebase US 7.01 - Secure Logout for Ophthalmologists All Oct 11 Codebase US 1.01 - Fundus Image Upload All Oct 11 Teamwork Create meeting minutes All Oct 11"},{"location":"project-plan/#sprint-3-modified-prototype-and-implemented-more-of-the-should-have-user-stories","title":"Sprint 3: Modified prototype and implemented more of the should have user stories","text":""},{"location":"project-plan/#due-oct-25","title":"Due: Oct 25","text":"Rubric Description Task To-Do Assigned To Date To Complete By Requirements Update git issue tracker All Oct 18 Codebase US 2.01 - Segment Optic Disc All Oct 25 Codebase US 3.01 - Organize Results All Oct 25 Teamwork Create meeting minutes All Oct 25"},{"location":"project-plan/#sprint-4-prototype-with-all-should-have-user-stories-implimented","title":"Sprint 4: Prototype with all should have user stories implimented","text":""},{"location":"project-plan/#due-nov-11","title":"Due: Nov 11","text":"Rubric Description Task To-Do Assigned To Date To Complete By Requirements Update git issue tracker All Nov 4 Codebase US 4.01 - Display Segmentation Results All Nov 11 Codebase US 4.02 - Display Past Segmentation Results All Nov 11 Codebase US 4.03 - Display Multiple Segmentation Results All Nov 11 Teamwork Create meeting minutes All Nov 11"},{"location":"project-plan/#sprint-5-finalize-everything","title":"Sprint 5: Finalize everything","text":""},{"location":"project-plan/#due-nov-22","title":"Due: Nov 22","text":"Rubric Description Task To-Do Assigned To Date To Complete By Requirements Update git issue tracker All Nov 15 Codebase Finish any left over All Nov 22 Codebase Frontend Code stylesheet refactoring All Nov 22 Teamwork Create meeting minutes All Nov 22 Teamwork Create presentation All Nov 22 <p>Can you create a todo 'Frontend Code stylesheet refactoring' and put it in the last sprint?</p>"},{"location":"report/","title":"Project Management","text":""},{"location":"report/#sprint-1-report","title":"Sprint 1 Report","text":"<p>All of the following tasks were completed in Sprint 1:</p> <ul> <li>Create use cases or user stories (2H): Use cases and user stories were created to define the requirements of the project.
